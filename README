digest is a tiny program to compute various kinds of digests. digest is designed
to be a drop-in-replacement for the following utilities: sum, cksum, shasum,
sha1sum, sha224sum, and sha256sum. It is capable of computing a wide range of
checksums. See digest.1 for more details.

digest should compile on any unixoid platform. The code uses only C89 language
features, some C99 headers (stdint.h) and POSIX functions. The only non-standard
function digest uses is alloca(). digest assumes that alloca is declared in
<stdlib.h>.

In cksum mode, digest mostly obeys POSIX, except for the fact that it still
supports all its flags, even though POSIX states that cksum takes no flags.

This program installs itself as a series of hardlinks for all the programs it
can emulate. If you want to add or remove digests, edit main.c and remove the
appropriate lines from digests.
